3D Language Embedded Consistency Policy


This work presents 3D Language Embedded Consistency Policy, a method for using language embeddings and Gaussian Splatting to learn a Consistency Policy. 

## Quickstart
This repository relies on two repos: a forked version of [LEGaussians](https://github.com/peasant98/LEGaussians) and [Consistency Policy](https://github.com/Aaditya-Prasad/Consistency-Policy/). We currently have most of the perception side of the pipeline working.
To get it setup:
